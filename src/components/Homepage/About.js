            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>A little bit about me, I'm a DevOps Engineer by trade now. I say now because as of Novemeber 2021 I got my first DevOps role after previously been in 
                a platform Engineering role, without very much DevOps. Tech can sometimes be daunting, even to the veterans amoung us...so this is the main reason
                behind creating this blog! It will hopefully serve two purposes, one being reinforcing my learning, and the secondly, it hopefully provides some
                insights and possible teachings into the world of DevOps for the reader! </p>
            <p>
                All I can say is I hope you enjoy!
            </p>
